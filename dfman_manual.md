# Basic Usage

- When you start into _dfman_, you will be greeted with the contents of your current directory.
    - From here, you can: 
        - go down a level in the folder tree
        - open into a new folder
        - open a file with the default application for your system
        - open an options menu for a particular file on your system

## Opening into a folder or file

- Just enter the listing number for the folder or file.
- For example, if the folder "Cute dog pictures" is listed as item # 0, then in the command line I will just enter `0` and hit ENTER.
- For folders, you will remain in _dfman_, and the screen will refresh to show you the contents of the directory you just navigated to.
- For files, the file will open with your default application, for example a .pdf file on my system will open in Okular.

## Going Down a Level in Tree Folder

- Use the `b` command. Just hit `b` on the command line and hit ENTER. 
- `b` is short for back, which you can also enter.
